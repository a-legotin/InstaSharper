## Easy to use
#### Use builder to get Insta API instance:
```c#
var api = new InstaApiBuilder()
                .UseLogger(new SomeLogger())
                .UseHttpClient(new SomeHttpClient())
                .SetUser(new UserCredentials(...You user...))
                .UseHttpClient(httpHandlerWithSomeProxy)
                .Build();
```
##### Note: every API method has synchronous implementation as well

### Quick Examples
#### Login
```c#
IResult<bool> loggedIn = await api.LoginAsync();
```

#### Get user:
```c#
IResult<InstaUser> user = await api.GetUserAsync();
```

#### Get all user posts:
```c#
IResult<InstaMediaList> media = await api.GetUserMediaAsync();
```

#### Get media by its code:
```c#
IResult<InstaMedia> mediaItem = await api.GetMediaByIdAsync("1234567891234567891_123456789);
```

#### Get user timeline feed:
```c#
IResult<InstaFeed> feed = await api.GetUserFeedAsync();
```

#### Comment post:
```c#
IResult<bool> postResult = await apiInstance.CommentMediaAsync("1234567891234567891_123456789", "Hi there!");
```
